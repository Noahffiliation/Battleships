# Battleships Project
This project involved writing a Battleships AI to play against other AI in a contest. I wrote up the SmarterPlayer that shot every third column and skipped a row in order to find enemy ships as quickly as possible. When it finds a hit, it tracks the four cardinal spots for additional hits until it sinks the enemy ship.
